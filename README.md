                     ⭐ ALX Polly Pro - Polling App with QR Code Sharing

A modern, full-stack polling application built with Next.js, Supabase, and TailwindCSS. This project extends the base polling app with advanced, production-ready features to make it portfolio-quality and demonstrate real-world problem-solving.

Users can create, share, and participate in polls while enjoying a sleek, responsive experience with features like real-time updates, role-based access, and QR code sharing.

                           🚀 Features

Role-Based Access (Auth): Admins manage polls, while regular users participate.

Real-Time Updates: Live updates for voting and results without page refresh.

QR Code Sharing: Each poll has a unique QR code for quick sharing across devices.

Result Charts: Visualize votes using interactive charts.

Notifications: Email or in-app alerts for poll updates or closing events.

Accessibility & Mobile Friendly: Designed for all devices and WCAG-compliant.

Secure Authentication: Powered by Supabase Auth.

User Dashboard: Manage polls, view performance, and track engagement.

                                      🤖 AI Integration Plan
																			
🧱 Code or Feature Generation

I will use Trae as my AI-enhanced IDE to scaffold components, functions, routes, and models. For example, I’ll prompt Trae to generate a PollResultChart component with preconfigured charting logic, or a RoleGuard wrapper for role-based access.

🧪 Testing Support

I plan to use AI to scaffold both unit and integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

Example prompt: “Generate a test suite for this poll creation function, covering both success and failure cases with Supabase.”

Example prompt: “Write an integration test to simulate a user voting and verify real-time updates appear in the chart.”

📡 Schema-Aware or API-Aware Generation

When working with Supabase, I’ll provide my database schema (tables, relationships) to AI so it can generate query functions. For example, I’ll paste the schema for the polls and votes tables into Trae and ask it to generate TypeScript functions for inserting and retrieving votes.

💬 Documentation

I’ll rely on AI to help write docstrings, inline comments, and README updates. Throughout development, I’ll feed AI file diffs and ask it to summarize changes in clear, professional language.

In-Editor/PR Review Tooling: I’ll use CodeRabbit connected to GitHub for code review automation, AI commit message generation, and PR summaries.

Prompting Strategy:

“Summarize this pull request as if it were a release note.”

“Generate a test suite for this authentication function following JWT token structure.”
