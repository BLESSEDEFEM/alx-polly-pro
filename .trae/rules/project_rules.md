Some basic rules for you to commit to memory and use as my personal guide in this project:

1. On Docstrings, comments: 
         modify these when there are major changes to functions, files, logic, output/outcome etc

2. Code reviews:
          suggest code reviews/improvements automatically (as pop up notification) to me, WHEN appropriate, explaining what needs review and why (e.g bugs, errors  or missing validations, style or formatting issues, unclear logic/comments). Create a section called "Code Reviews" in README.md(which should be a living/evolving document throughout the project) which contains the implemented reviews/improvements

3. Commits:
         remind me (as pop up notification) to commit, when it is very very necessary to do so (e.g after modification to functions or files, project structure) and to take screenshot of AI-generated commits and to label the AI-generated commit parts.

4. Generate a living/evolving changelogs of entries (that is, summary of changes between commits or versions of my code), automatically.

5. prompt me (by notification pop up) of redundant codes, so i can delete them appropriately

6. Prompt me (by notification pop up) to take screenshots when these happen:
     AI-scaffolding of a new component
     AI code review suggestions
     AI-generated commit messages
