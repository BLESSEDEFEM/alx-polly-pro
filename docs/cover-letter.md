Dear [Company Name] Hiring Team,

I’m excited to apply for the [Role Title] role. Through the ALX Software Engineering Program and ALX AI for Developers II, I’ve built hands‑on projects across GenAI/RAG and full‑stack web development. I’m comfortable working with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), and shipping production‑ready features in Next.js and Supabase (PostgreSQL).

Recent work includes an end‑to‑end polling application (Next.js + Supabase/PostgreSQL) with secure authentication, protected routes, and a robust password recovery flow designed server‑side for reliability. I’ve also delivered AI‑assisted tools such as a Code Review Agent that analyzes code and provides actionable improvements. I prioritize clear problem‑solving, clean code, and rapid iteration while collaborating effectively in remote teams.

I’d welcome the opportunity to contribute to [Company Name] by building reliable AI features, optimizing developer workflows, and supporting data‑driven product decisions. Thank you for your time and consideration. I’d be happy to share more projects or discuss how my background can help your team.

Sincerely,

Your Name
